      <h2>Tanzanite</h2>
      <p>A rare stone with a deep purple sparkle, tanzanite is one of the newest gemstones available in jewellery and was discovered as recently as 1967. All tanzanites used in jewelry come from a single mine in the Merelani Hills in Tanzania. Tanzanite isn't quite as hard as the “big four”. This alone prevents it being classified as a precious stone, although it is as rare if not rarer, highly sought after and beautiful. We are proud to use the highest quality tanzanite in Sheila's designs, like the beautiful Swirl Ring in white gold set by hand with a tanzanite and diamond.
